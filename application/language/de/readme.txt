Changed the translation from single file, to folder.. 
so now it will only use the files inside the folder language/[options.language.lang]

DE uses /application/language/de
please add in /application/language/de/de.php the generic translations
or/and
create /application/language/de/[controller].php file for your specific needs

"overwrite" folder was added
translations in those files are config-based for each client, and they overwrite it original ones
